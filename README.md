## Typography

I decided to go with Teko for my headings and menus font. I decided on Teko because I feel it has a strong yet sleek element to it, and the website being a gym website, strong feels fitting for the purpose.

I chose to go with Montserrat for all my text, I feel the Montserrat compliments Teko quite well. It is easy on the eyes and sleek looking.
